        I am Pedro Sousa, a Software Engineer with a passion for continuous
        learning and innovation. Currently working at Microsoft, I contribute as
        part of the Feedback team for Office 365, specializing in developing and
        enhancing full-stack solutions using technologies like C++, TypeScript,
        JavaScript, and React. Most of my professional experience has been as a
        web developer, where I honed my skills in crafting scalable,
        user-friendly applications that deliver real-world value. However, I am
        always eager to step out of my comfort zone and embrace new challenges,
        whether itâ€™s exploring emerging technologies, diving deeper into backend
        systems, or venturing into entirely new domains of software development.
